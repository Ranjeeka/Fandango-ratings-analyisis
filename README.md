# Fandango-ratings-analyisis
In October 2015, a data journalist named Walt Hickey analyzed movie ratings data and found strong evidence to suggest that Fandango's rating system was biased and dishonest (Fandango is an online movie ratings aggregator). He published his analysis in this article.  In this project, we'll analyze more recent movie ratings data to determine whether there has been any change after Hickey's analysis.
